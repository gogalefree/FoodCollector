Instructions for setting up the pre-build script
==========================================================

1. In Xcode, in the Project Navigator goto “Supporting Files” -> “Scripts” and click the “PreBuildScript.swift” files once to select it.
2. In the File Inspector pane (on the left side) select the Full Path and copy it.
3. Back in the Project Navigator, select the name of the project “FoodCollector” and in the main Xcode window click “Build Phases”.
4. Locate the section called “Run Script” and click the little arrow next to the name to expand and view its content.
5. You will see a path similar to this:
    /Users/Boris/Developer/Projects/FoodCollector4/FoodCollector/FoodCollector/Scripts/PreBuildScript.swift
6. Select this path, delete it and replace it with the path you’ve copied in step 2.

Instructions for changing the type of build
==========================================================

1. With the pre-build script you can create three different builds: Dev, Beta and Production.
2. By default the pre-build script creates a Dev build. So, there’s no need to do anything to the script if you only need a regular dev build.
3. If you wish to make a Beta or a Production build, you need to tell the script what type of build to create.
4. This is done by sending and argument to the pre-build script before you run the build.
5. There are two types of arguments: “beta” and “prod”
6. To add an argument to the pre-build script, in the Project Navigator, select the name of the project “FoodCollector” and in the main Xcode window click “Build Phases”.
7. Locate the section called “Run Script” and click the little arrow next to the name to expand and view its content.
8. You will see a path similar to this:
   /Users/Boris/Developer/Projects/FoodCollector4/FoodCollector/FoodCollector/Scripts/PreBuildScript.swift
9. Goto the end of the path (just after the “PreBuildScript.swift” file name) add one space and write “beta” (without the commas)
10. Your script should look similar to this:
    /Users/Boris/Developer/Projects/FoodCollector4/FoodCollector/FoodCollector/Scripts/PreBuildScript.swift beta
11. The example above will generate a Beta build. you wish to generate a Production build replace the argument “beta” with “prod” (without the commas).

NOTE: If the script doesn’t work or you get error during the build process, contact me for help (Boris Tsigelman)
